              <p>"We had clients coming in from overseas, it was the biggest meeting of my career.  On the day off, two hours before we were set to sit down over food and talk business that was pivotal to the growth of our company and the catering business we had hired called to say they had accidentally overbooked and were unable cater our event.  After speaking with In A Pinch, it won't matter whether I'm under pressure or planning well in advance, I'm calling In A Pinch from the start."</p>

              <p>"Many of my guests commented about how great they were. They were friendly, upbeat and very accommodating! I didn’t even need to clean afterwards and I am very fussy so that says a lot! My friends all said how great the food was. I heard people say it was a first class event-very elegant and I couldn’t agree more! There were a ton of choices on the menus and they were really helpful in directing me to my final selections. I will definitely recommend In a Pinch to friends and family!!"</p>
